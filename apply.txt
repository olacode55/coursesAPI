Hi [friend’s first name],

Hope all is going well in your world!


I am considering a career change and exploring career alternatives. Working as a Software Developer at Precise Financial Systems for past years has been great, but I'd like to grow my skill set and expand my horizons.

So, I’m exploring opportunities with new employers , With a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and experience using .Net languages to create, implement and troubleshoot software application, I am confident i will be an asset to your organization 

. Given your wide experience and network has a human resource manager, I would love if you could schedule a time for us to discuss how my skills and my experience could benefit your organization. You can reach me on my mobile number (+2348166860033) 
and Email Address (Olatunjiabiola71@yahoo.com). I look forward to meeting with you.

Thank you so much for your assistance on this. Please let me know if you need more information.

Sincerely,

Olatunji Abiola.


I would be glad to get an opportunity of an interview at Vatebra Limited to  discuss in detailswork in your organization has a software Developer.

If you have some time to spare in the next 3 weeks, it would be great to meet with your to discuss the  get together for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, even lunch or dinner (my treat!). Give me a couple of date/time options that would work best for you, and we'll find a time to connect.

If you're too busy to get together now, a short (15 or 20 minutes) phone call would be a great, too. Just let me know the best time and phone number for you.

I'd love to catch up on what's happening in your world and also have an opportunity to pick your brain about this topic. As the Beatles sang so many years ago, "We get by with a little help from our friends."

Thank you so much for your assistance on this. Please let me know how I can help you.

Regards,
[Your name]
